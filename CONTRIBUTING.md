# Contributing to T-REX Protocol

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. Our test suite uses TypeScript and Hardhat.
3. Ensure the test suite passes. Tests are automated and any PR will trigger them automatically.
4. Make sure your code lints. We use [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) for Solidity and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for TypeScript.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We're using [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) for Solidity and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for TypeScript. Make sure your code follows the style guide.

## Commit Messages

We encourage the use of [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for commit messages. It's a fun and easy way to identify the purpose or intent of a commit with a simple emoji.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GPL v3 License.
