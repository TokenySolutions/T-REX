     * - Transfers the address freeze status from `_lostWallet` to `_newWallet`,
     *   ensuring the new wallet retains any restrictions if applicable.
     * - Updates the identity registry:
     *   - If `_lostWallet` is listed in the identity registry, it will be removed,

     *

     * - `TokensUnfrozen` if there are frozen tokens on `_lostWallet` that are transferred.
     * - `TokensFrozen` if frozen tokens are added to `_newWallet`.
     * - `AddressFrozen` if the freeze status of either wallet changes.
     * - `Transfer` to reflect the movement of tokens from `_lostWallet` to `_newWallet`.
     * - `RecoverySuccess` upon successful completion of the recovery process.
     *
     * Reverts if:
     * - The agent calling the function does not have the necessary permissions to perform recovery (`AgentNotAuthorized`).
     * - The `_lostWallet` has no tokens to recover (`NoTokenToRecover`).
     * - Neither `_lostWallet` nor `_newWallet` is present in the identity registry (`RecoveryNotPossible`).
